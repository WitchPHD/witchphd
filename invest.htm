		<br />My 'lazy portfolio' is <span class='BND'>10% BND/VTEB</span>, <span class='VTI'>30% VTI</span>, <span class='VXUS'>30% VXUS</span>, <span class='FLEX'>30% Flex</span>.
		<p>Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. I believe my logic and methods are sound, but ultimately everyone's financial situation is different and any online advice is to be followed AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p>
		<p> Personally I'm a big fan of <a href='https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Bogleheads%C2%AE_investment_philosophy'>Jack Bogle's Investment Philsophy</a> which emphasizes long-term buying-and-holding of low-cost index funds, and I highly encourage anyone who hasn't started planning for the future to set up an account on <a href='https://investor.vanguard.com'/>Vanguard</a> and do exactly that. Many 'Bogleheads' follow <a href='https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio'>a simple 3-fund portfolio</a> which holds some amount of <span class='BND'>BND (Total Bond ETF) or VTEB (Tax Exempt Bond ETF)</span>, <span class='VTI'>VTI (Total U.S. Stock ETF)</span>, and <span class='VXUS'>VXUS (Total Stock Excluding U.S.)</span> to broadly invest in the whole market. My portfolio allocates 70% of its space for the 3-fund, and then uses 30% for <span class='FLEX'>flexible space</span> to satisfy my (dangerous) urge to tinker and optimize with other ETFs.</p>
		<p>I follow this portfolio layout in all my accounts, using <span class='BND'>VTEB</span> in my taxable accounts and <span class='BND'>BND</span> in my tax-deferred accounts, and having different stuff in the <span class='FLEX'>FLEX</span> space depending on the account.</p>
		<p>I currently speculate we are in an 'AI Bubble' and <span class='VTI'>VTI</span> is too heavily weighted into big tech, so my flex space is trying to add weight into other sectors. <span class='FLEX'>VYM (High Dividend Yield ETF)</span> adds some weight in value stocks (energy, utilities, consumer staples, and financials) that are established enough to have a track record of producing dividends. Dividends don't technically add much safety, but they feel comfy to me since you get paid a little bit even when the market is down. I hold <span class='FLEX'>10% VNQ (Real Estate ETF)</span> in my tax-deferred acount to add some extra exposure to Real Estate / REITs, which some theories say offers extra diversification.</p>
